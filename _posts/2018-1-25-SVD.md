basis for row space : v1
basis for col space : u1

Av1 = sigma u1 (same number of basic cuz number of basis for row space = no of basis for col space = rank )
=> AV  = ZU (U and V and Z max length = r, now we need to extend it to m)

A^TA = V Z^2 V^T. A^TA is symetric so it can be diagonalizaed (spectral theorem) -> V is eigenvectors of A^TA, they are orthonormal vector. Same for U.


NOW HOW TO FILL UP THE REST OF VECTOR TO COMPLETE SVD?
IS THIS A LEGIT PROOF FOR EXISTENCE OF SVD?
